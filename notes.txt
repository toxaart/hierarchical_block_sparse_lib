This repository is intended for a hierarchical block-sparse matrix
library that Anton Artemov is working on.

The idea is that this library could be used as a leaf matrix library
instead of e.g. block_sparse_matrix_lib or basic_matrix_lib especially
for the purpose of testing the SpAMM multiplication approach.
